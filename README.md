An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in game items and videos . NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain and are therefore individual tokens containing additional information. This extra information is the important part, which allows them to take the form of art, music, video (and so on), in the form of JPG, MP3, videos, GIFs. Because they have value, they can be bought and sold like other types of art . Their value is largely determined by the rarity, tangibility and value in the future.
